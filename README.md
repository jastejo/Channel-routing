# Channel-routing
Channel routing:                                In channel routing the storage is a function of both inflows and outflow discharges. The flow in a river during a flood belongs to gradually varied unsteady flow. Considering a channel reach having flood flow the total volume in storage can be considered into two components 1. Prism storage 2. Wedge storage.  Using the continuity equation, a relation between inflow and outflow and storage is given as below.                 (I1+I2) *∆ t/2 -(Q1+Q2) *∆t/2=∆S Muskingum Equation is used I for channel routing purposes                                                                       S=K([x*I+(1-x) *Q]  Where K and x are coefficients. The coefficient is known as K is known as storage –time constant for the reach. K is usually close to travel time within the reach and x is known weighing factor and takes value between 0 and 0.5. The value of x averages about 0.2.  It is attempted to calculate the values of k and x for the observed inflow and outflow hydrographs in a river reach using Python programming.
